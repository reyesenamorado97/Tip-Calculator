# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Robert Reyes-Enamorado**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Settings screen to change app defaults (Rounding, Tip Percentage Control)
- [X] Party Size stepper to calculate the split amount amongst the amount of people in the party
- [X] Dark mode switch to change between a lighter or darker UI
- [X] Rounding function through a segmented control

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The most timue consuming portion of the prework was the research behind learning Swift. This is my first time using Swift so a good deal of testing took place to make sure I was using the language correctly and efficiently. After finding my stride, buiding the app became much easier and most of my time went into the way the UI looked, not fixing bugs.
